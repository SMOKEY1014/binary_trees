 * binary_tree_preorder - Goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal

 * Description: This function traverses the binary tree rooted at @tree using
 * pre-order traversal and calls the function @func for each visited node.
 * The value in each node is passed as a parameter to the function @func.
 * If @tree or @func is NULL, the function does nothing.
